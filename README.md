# Pymaceutical-Challenge
# I completed this challenge with some help from the tutors and also using class challenges as a reference point
# Xpert learning was a great tool to help with certain lines which were more challenging than others
# I was not able to complete the last part because I kept getting errors but I will try to solve it and re-submit if possible
